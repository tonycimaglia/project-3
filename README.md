# ParkShare

## App Overview:

Park Share is a web app that allows users to find free parking in the city of Atlanta. Parking spaces are organized by neighborhood. Users who own parking spaces in the city are able to create private spaces for people to use. In addition to the private spaces, there is a database of public parking spots that people are able to use as well.

## Approach:

I knew exactly what I wanted to build out when I started this project, but once I got to work, I realized that my understanding of React wasn't sufficient enough to build what I wanted. I ran into problems frequently and it really forced me to go back and solidify my knowledge of the core principles of React. 

## Unsolved Problems:

Users aren't yet able to add public and private spaces to the database. I'm also havving trouble building out an add user page that lives in it's own component.


## Version 2: 

In version two:

* Users will be able to Add, Update, and Delete parking spaced from the database of public and private spaces.

* Individual neighborhoods will have their own view. In that view, users will have the option to view the public spaces in that neighborhood, private spaces, or view them both at the same time. 

* When a space is occupied, users will be able to toggle a boolean which will flag that space as unavailable.
